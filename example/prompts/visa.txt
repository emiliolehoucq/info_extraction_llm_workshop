Below I will provide a job posting.

Based on the text of the job posting, tell me whether the hiring organization can sponsor a visa or work authorization for international workers.

Your response should be one of “yes”, “no”, or “missing”.

If the job posting mentions that the hiring organization is able to sponsor a visa or work authorization for international workers, respond "yes". These are example indications that sponsorship is available:
- "Visa sponsorship is available"
- "able to sponsor the employment of international workers in this role"
- "If you need a visa, we cover most visa costs"
- "Visa Sponsored Job: Yes"

If the job posting mentions that the hiring organization is not able to sponsor a visa or work authorization for international workers, respond "no". These are example indications that sponsorship is not available:
- "U.S. citizenship is required"
- "will not offer visa sponsorship for this opportunity"
- "will not sponsor employment authorization for this position"
- "is not a sponsoring agency for staff or management positions (e.g., H-1B visa). Applicants must currently be authorized to work in the United States"

Keep in mind that this information is typically buried in the job posting, so read very carefully every detail.

If the job posting doesn't mention anything about visa or work authorization for international workers, respond "missing".
