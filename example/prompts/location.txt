Below I will provide a job posting.

Based on the text of the job posting, tell me the location of the position.

If the location is in the United States, I want the city and the state (e.g., "Evanston, IL").

If the location is outside of the United States, I want the city and the country (e.g., "Berlin, Germany") and, if mentioned in the job posting, the state as well (e.g., "Toronto, Ontario, Canada"). 

If the job posting doesn't mention the location, respond "missing".

Here is the job posting:
