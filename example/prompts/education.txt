Below I will provide a job posting.

Based on the text of the job posting, tell me the minimum education required for the position.

Your response should be one of "associate", "bachelor", "master", "phd", or “missing”.

Keep in mind that it's the minimum education required. For example, for "Minimum Education Bachelor's degree is required. Master's degree or PHD is preferred", the answer would be "bachelor".

If the job posting doesn't mention anything about the minimum education required, respond "missing".
